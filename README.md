## Overall Project Architecture

AI AUTHOR features a modular architecture that seamlessly integrates three key components for robust functionality. The frontend, developed with ReactJS \cite{reactjs}, prioritizes a user-friendly interface for easy accessibility. Simultaneously, the backend, powered by FastAPI \cite{fastapi}, establishes a reliable foundation. At the core of this architecture is the integration of ChatGPT APIs \cite{artificial}, driving linguistic analysis and text generation capabilities. These APIs enable advanced features such as grammatical correction, precise paraphrasing, dynamic text translation, and the generation of scientific articles. AI AUTHOR stands out as a versatile tool, catering to the nuanced needs of both researchers and writers. For a visual representation, refer to Figure \ref{fig:enter-label-1}.
